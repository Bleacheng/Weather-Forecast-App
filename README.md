# Project: Weather Forecast Application

## Description:
Create a weather forecast application that allows users to check the weather conditions for different locations. The application should fetch weather data from a public weather API and display it in an easy-to-read format. Users should also have the option to save their favorite locations for quick access.

## Key Features:

### Frontend (Next.js):

- User registration and login.
- User dashboard to manage favorite locations.
- Search functionality to find weather information for specific cities.
- Display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather condition.
- Display a 5-day weather forecast with daily high and low temperatures.
- Option to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.
- Error handling for invalid locations or API failures.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.

### Backend (Node.js/Express, or your preferred backend technology):

- User authentication and authorization to protect user data.
- RESTful API endpoints to:
- Allow users to add and remove favorite locations.
- Fetch weather data from a public weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or Weather API) using HTTP requests.
- Store user data, including favorite locations, in a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Error handling for API requests and database interactions.
- Secure storage of sensitive user data (passwords, API keys) using encryption and best practices.
- Implement caching to reduce the number of API calls and improve application performance.
- Rate limiting and API key management for third-party API access.

### Additional Enhancements (Optional):

- Implement real-time updates for weather data using WebSockets.
- Geolocation feature to automatically detect the user's current location.
- Weather alerts and notifications for extreme weather conditions.
- Integration with multiple weather APIs for redundancy and more accurate data.
- Data visualization using charts and graphs to display historical weather trends.
- Mobile app versions for Android and iOS using React Native.
- By building this Weather Forecast Application, you'll gain experience in working with user authentication, API integration, database management, and creating a responsive user interface. It's a practical project that can also be expanded and customized based on your preferences and learning goals.
